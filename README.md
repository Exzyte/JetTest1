# JetTest1
## A versatile test of my ability in highschool IT.
Custom 2D rendering API for a project in IT high school. Using Visual Studio and C#, I've created a simple, custom and controllable image render API for Windows Forms projects. The API is very light, and very simple to use. It took a total of 4 days to complete and was tested, controlled and moved around. It also posses the ability to render a custom background, layers, or unload images based on set layers as well. It's simple usability makes it easily implementable into any Windows Form.

The implementation of layers works on a base where the background is recommended to be created first and as you layer images, those who are the newest/highest render first, and the ones that render below them are the ones that are stated at the start.

Controlling the image is simple as well, creating a loop where it checks for your keyboard input (such as arrow keys), you are able to move it on the screen by controlling how many pixels it moves by per tap or press. It works for holding as well.
It has been tested to only use 20 MB/s in total (including the windows forms window itself and microsoft's runtime).

_Feel free to improve on this if you like it! Just make sure to link the original that I made here!_
_As stated before, this was a fun project that I did for myself and as a show of understanding. If anything's wrong, you're free to do what you want with it._
